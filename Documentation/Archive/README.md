# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation from earlier stages of the replication project that has been **SUPERSEDED** by more recent fixes and updates.

## Current Documentation

For the most up-to-date and accurate information, please refer to:

**📄 [PERFECT_REPLICATION_ACHIEVED.md](../../PERFECT_REPLICATION_ACHIEVED.md)** (Root directory)

This is the authoritative documentation reflecting the final state of the project as of November 15, 2025.

## Files in This Archive

These files document the project status at various points during the fix process but are now outdated:

- `COMPLETE_VERIFICATION_REPORT_FINAL.md` - Status before Script 54 was fixed (19:07)
- `FINAL_STATUS_AND_FIXES_NEEDED.md` - Fix instructions for issues that are now resolved (18:54)
- `CRITICAL_FIXES_SUMMARY_2025-11-15.md` - Status before Script 53 quintile 4 was fixed (12:31)
- `VERIFICATION_FINDINGS_2025-11-15.md` - Initial verification findings (earlier in day)

## Why Archived

These files claimed Script 54 was "50% complete" or Script 53 was "9/10 quintiles" - both issues have since been fixed to 100%. To avoid confusion, they have been moved here.

## Historical Value

These files are preserved for:
- Understanding the debugging process
- Documenting the evolution of fixes
- Providing context for commit history
- Academic transparency
